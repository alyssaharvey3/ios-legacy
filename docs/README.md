# Building the Docs

The iOS documentation isn't built directly; instead it is built when [the administration, developer, and user manuals](https://github.com/owncloud/docs/) are made.
To learn more about how to build the documentation, please refer to [that project's documentation](https://github.com/owncloud/docs/blob/master/docs/build-the-docs.md).
